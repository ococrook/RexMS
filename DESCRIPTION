Description: RexMS is a user-friendly software designed for scientists studying
  proteins and their dynamics. It uses Bayesian methods to analyze data 
  from HDX-MS experiments, which helps in understanding how protein dynamics
  at the levle of residues. RexMS makes it easier to get detailed insights into
  protein behaviors, It's a powerful tool if you wish to study differences
  in protein dynamics with statistical rigour at the level of residues.
